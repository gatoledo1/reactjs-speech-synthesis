        This voice synthesizer has paragraph breaking in arrays, thus solving a problem found in Android, which does not allow speech of more than 4000 characters. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At each end of speech, the array index is updated, so the synthesizer only sees paragraph by paragraph. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The pause also follows the paragraph break, because in the synthesizer web API the pause doesn't work very well, after 4 seconds, the audio is canceled and returns to the beginning. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Another bug found on Android is that the language has a name with "_" (underscore), instead of "-" (hyphen), which causes a problem when picking up the voices.
